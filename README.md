# SUPERDRY

SUPERHOT fan game where you have to avoid getting wet.

# supARdry / supARhot / supARwarm

Same as before, but in AR using `three.js`.

# IMLEX AR

Scan IMLEX logo to get a nice animation of the logo coming up and spinning as an insignia.

# CubeBro AR support

Add AR support to CubeBro so he can flex anywhere, anytime. [Link here](https://github.com/Fabulani/fabulani.github.io/blob/main/imlex/real-time-3d-xr-visualization/pw1-geometry-cameras-controls/pw1-ex4-ex5.html).

# Hiragana characters stories

For each hiragana character, make a three.js scene representing its combination of building blocks (as seen in the app `Hiragana Quest`). For example, for `KE`, it's a combination of `COBRA + SAMURAI = KEBAB` (see Hiragana Quest to understand), as such the scene would be a samurai sitting by a bonfire cooking a dead snake with his katana, and the hiragana `KE` floating above it.
